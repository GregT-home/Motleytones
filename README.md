# README

This app serves up the current static Motley Tones website.

Currently

* Delivers static pages with DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) layout
 * About Motley Tones
 * Biographies of the group
 * Performance Schedule and Bookint
 * Photos
 * Videos

Future features:

* Generate schedule from independent data source
* Strike out gigs on schedule that are past
* Optional: create user logins for administrative use
* Optional: Allow gig information to be added/updated/deleted via web
* Optional: generate video page from database

Trello Board for this project can be [found here](https://trello.com/b/VwHfdHD4/motley-tones-web-app).

The original static page was created using the [HTML5 Verti design](http://html5up.net/verti).  This app is generally based on that styling, but no longer uses any of the original code or packages.
